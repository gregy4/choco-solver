 * "The coordinator of a local golf club has come to you with the following problem.
 * In her club, there are 32 social golfers, each of whom play golf once a week,
 * and always in groups of 4.
 * She would like you to come up with a schedule of play for these golfers,
 * to last as many weeks as possible, such that
 * no golfer plays in the same group as any other golfer on more than one occasion.
 * <p/>
 * The problem can easily be generalized to that of scheduling
 * m groups of
 * n golfers over
 * p weeks,
 * such that no golfer plays in the same group as any other golfer twice
 * (i.e. maximum socialisation is achieved)
